NL-RSE was formed in April 2017 after the example of the RSE communities in the [UK](http://rse.ac.uk) and [Germany](http://www.de-rse.org/en/). 

The initiative was taken by the [Netherlands eScience Center](http://www.esciencecenter.nl)
and [ePLAN](https://escience-platform.nl/) to bring together the RSE community in the Netherlands.

The community is growing quickly! RSEs working in institutes across the country have already joined NL-RSE:
