NL-RSE is organizing the NL-RSE19 conference on November 20 at the Johan Cruijff ArenA, Amsterdam.
<!--break-->

**When: 20 November 2019**

**Where: [Johan Cruijff ArenA](https://www.johancruijffarena.nl/) in Amsterdam**

**Registration: [Click here](https://21pryvp.momice.events/)**

At NL-RSE19, we will bring together the Research Software Engineers (RSE) community to talk about, building the community, best practices for creating research software, and other RSE related
topics. The conference will take place on the 20th of November, at the Johan Cruijff ArenA, Amsterdam.

NL-RSE19 is co-located with the [National eScience Symposium 2019](https://www.esciencesymposium2019.nl/) taking place the following day, and we greatly appreciate the Netherlands eScience Center
for sponsoring the venue.

The increasing use of data and digital technology in academia has gone hand in hand with a strong growth in people who write and contribute to research software. Positions like data steward,
information manager, research data officer, research software engineer, research supporter and other titles are increasingly recognized as intrinsic positions in the academic system.

Following the great initiatives in the UK and Germany, we plan to bring together the community of people writing and contributing to research software from Dutch universities, knowledge
institutes, companies and other organizations to share knowledge, to organize meetings, and raise awareness for the scientific recognition of research software.

## Who should attend?
- Researchers who develop software for research purposes
- Software developers working in a research context
- People from any organisation providing services to facilitate research software: tools makers, infrastructure providers, computing services, data centers, etc.
- Anyone with a stake in research software (funders, publishers, decision makers, etc).
