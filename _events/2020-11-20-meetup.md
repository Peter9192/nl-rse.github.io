## Abstracts
## Grlc user meeting -- how do you apply grlc, what could be better, what's really bad?
[grlc](https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc) is a lightweight server that creates Web APIs to access Linked Data. SPARQL queries are transformed into API endpoints. API parameters can be mapped to query variables, adding flexibility to how the data is accessed.

Grlc has been successfully used in a number of projects, but it is far from perfect. In this session we would like to have a discussion with grlc users (and potential users) to discuss what are the current limitations and points of improvement.

The outcome of this session will be the grlc roadmap -- a list of Github issues that the grlc developers (and potential contributors) can use to further develop grlc!

## Evidence -- a machine assisted close reading tool with support for abstract concept-based search and context-based search.

## Architecture and underlying principles of the CLARIAH Media Suite annotation tools
### How open standards improve the publication & exchange of (your) annotation data.
The [CLARIAH Media Suite](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/) serves media scholars and other (digital) humanities scholars by providing access to several (Dutch) audiovisual collections, such as television & radio programmes, films, newspapers and oral history interviews. The Media Suita annotation tools allow users to add and share personal annotations to specific audio visual resources, for example over a determined area on an image or at a specific time in a video. This talk details about the architecture and underlying principles of the Media Suite annotation tools and how open standards improve the publication & exchange of (your) annotation data.
