## Abstracts
## Grlc user meeting -- how do you apply grlc, what could be better, what's really bad?
[grlc](https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc) is a lightweight server that creates Web APIs to access Linked Data. SPARQL queries are transformed into API endpoints. API parameters can be mapped to query variables, adding flexibility to how the data is accessed.

Grlc has been successfully used in a number of projects, but it is far from perfect. In this session we would like to have a discussion with grlc users (and potential users) to discuss what are the current limitations and points of improvement.

The outcome of this session will be the grlc roadmap -- a list of Github issues that the grlc developers (and potential contributors) can use to further develop grlc!

## Evidence -- a machine assisted close reading tool with support for abstract concept-based search and context-based search.
Digitization of text corpora has benefited humanities research by simplifying access and enabling the use of text analysis tools. However, the standard entry point used by current systems is keyword based search - an entry point incompatible with proven methods of scholarly close reading. Close reading is a key element in the pursuit of research questions focussing on complex or abstract concepts. In these situations keyword search based entry point often proves to be very restrictive, making it difficult, if not impossible, to formulate adequate search criteria and queries. Here we present a machine assisted close reading tool called [Evidence](https://research-software.nl/software/evidence). It provides an alternative, intuitive entry point into collections.  

Evidence uses machine learning to extract a vector-space representation of the theme and content of all corpus elements. Using Evidence, users can query the corpus starting from elements embodying their research question. We call this concept-based querying. Additionally, Evidence allows classical word-based querying. This enables the user to search a large, digitised corpus with a focus on complex or abstract research questions. In this way Evidence assists the user's close reading.

This presentation provides the audience with the relevant background and shows what Evidence is capable of.
