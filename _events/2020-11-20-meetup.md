## Abstracts
## Grlc user meeting -- how do you apply grlc, what could be better, what's really bad?
[grlc](https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc) is a lightweight server that creates Web APIs to access Linked Data. SPARQL queries are transformed into API endpoints. API parameters can be mapped to query variables, adding flexibility to how the data is accessed.

Grlc has been successfully used in a number of projects, but it is far from perfect. In this session we would like to have a discussion with grlc users (and potential users) to discuss what are the current limitations and points of improvement.

The outcome of this session will be the grlc roadmap -- a list of Github issues that the grlc developers (and potential contributors) can use to further develop grlc!

## evidence -- a machine assisted close reading tool with support for abstract concept-based search and context-based search.

While research in the humanities has been able to leverage the digitization of text corpora and the development of computer based text analysis tools to its benefit, the interface current systems provide the user with is incompatible with the proven method of scholarly close reading of texts which is key in many research scenarios pursuing complex research questions.
In particular, for research questions debarking from more complex or abstract concepts, it is often restrictive and difficult, if not impossible, to formulate adequate selection criteria in the framework of a keyword based search, which is the standard entry point to digitized text collections.

Here we present evidence, a machine assisted close reading tool, which provides an alternative, intuitive entry point into collections. Using a machine learning framework to obtain abstract vector-space representations of the theme and content of all corpus elements, evidence
enables users to query the corpus departing from (user-selected) elements embodying their research question. This abstract concept based query functionality is augmented by classical (word) content based similarity querying within the same tool, enabling the user to efficiently peruse a large digitised corpus with a focus on a complex/abstract research question, I.e assisting their close reading.

This presentation will focus on briefly providing the audience with the relevant background as well as demonstrating use and abilities of the tool.
