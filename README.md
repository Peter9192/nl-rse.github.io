# NL-RSE

Welcome at NL-RSE: the Research Software Engineer community in the Netherlands. Following the great initiatives in the [UK](http://rse.ac.uk/) and [Germany](http://www.de-rse.org/de), we plan to bring together the community of Research Software Engineers from Dutch universities, knowledge institutes, companies and other relevant organizations to share knowledge, to organize meetings and raise awareness for the scientific recognition of research software.
 
As a start, we think of organizing a meetup of Research Software Engineers in the second half of 2017. We’ll soon make a mailinglist available to keep you up-to-date.

**Joining the RSE Community is easy – just sign up to our mailing list [here](https://lists.nl-rse.org/mailman/listinfo/everyone).**
