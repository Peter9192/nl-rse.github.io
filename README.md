## The Netherlands Research Software Engineer community

Welcome at NL-RSE: the Research Software Engineer community in the 
Netherlands. Following the great initiatives in the 
[UK](http://rse.ac.uk/) and [Germany](http://www.de-rse.org/de), 
we plan to bring together the community of Research Software 
Engineers from Dutch universities, knowledge institutes, companies 
and other relevant organizations to share knowledge, to organize 
meetings and raise awareness for the scientific recognition of 
research software.

We are planning to organize a meetup of Research Software Engineers in the second half of 2017. Signup to our mailing list to stay informed about any activities!

April, 2017


## Join us!

Joining the NL-RSE Community is easy â€“ just sign up to our mailing list [here](https://lists.nl-rse.org/mailman/listinfo/everyone).


## What is a Research Software Engineer?

Research Software Engineers (RSEs) closely collaborate with researchers
to understand the challenges they face, and then develop research
software to provide the answers. Some have started as researchers who
spent a lot of time developing software to do their research. Others
have started as software developers who have developed a strong affinity
with scientific research.

While the RSEs are extremely valuable to the scientific community, they
currently lack a formal place in the academic system. This means
there is no easy way to recognise their contribution, to reward
them, or to represent their views.

Without a name, it is difficult for people to rally around a
cause, that is why the term Research Software Engineer was
created. We are now working, together with RSE associations in the
[UK](http://rse.ac.uk/) and [Germany](http://www.de-rse.org/de),
to raise awareness of the role, and to bring the
RSE community in the Netherlands together.
