## The Netherlands Research Software Engineer community

The increasing use of data and digital technology in academia has gone hand
in hand with a strong growth in people who write and contribute to research
software. Positions like data steward, information manager, research data
officer, research software engineer, research supporter and other titles are
increasingly recognized as intrinsic positions in the academic system.

Following the great initiatives in the [UK](http://rse.ac.uk/) and
[Germany](http://www.de-rse.org/de), we plan to bring together the community
of people writing and contributing to research software from Dutch
universities, knowledge institutes, companies and other organizations to
share knowledge, to organize meetings, and raise awareness for the
scientific recognition of research software.
